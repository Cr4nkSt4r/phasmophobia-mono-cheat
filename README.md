# Phasmophobia Mono Cheat

Just an private project to learn some basic programming of Unreal Engine mono cheats.  
Release -> x64 will generate the `obj\x64\Release\PhasmoMonoCheat.dll`,  
which then can get injected, with an mono injector, into Phasmophobia.  
To get compilation running, create an folger named `Phasmophobia_Managed` in the same  
directory as `phasmophobia-mono-cheat` and copy/paste the contents of `Phasmophobia_Data\Managed`.  
Or you have to manual edit the References in the project.
